# Galaxy builder aggregation

This is a collection of scripts and jupyter notebooks used to perform data reduction and aggregation on the output classifications of Galaxy Builder

Generic useful scripts can be found in `/lib`, which is symlinked to each of the working directories.

Classification and subject exports can be found in `/classifications`

Apologies for the random scripts. I plan on cleaning up this repository eventually but need to allocate time to do it.
